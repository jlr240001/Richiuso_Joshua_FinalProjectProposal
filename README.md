# What is my project?
My project is a 2D side scroller modeled after the 2D dinosaur game from google chrome. The core gameplay is simple player inputs that cause the player to jump or duck in order to avoid obstacles,
in this case, enemies that appear as you go. Furthermore, the farther you progress/the longer you last, the faster your character becomes. This makes it more and more difficult to dodge the incoming enemies as time goes on. 

Here is the link to my video demonstration:

# My goals
My goals for the project were much more ambitious than how it turned out. Frankly, I simply followed a tutorial and tried to alter things, but usually ended up breaking it. However, I was able to incoorporate at least one element entirely distinct from the 
tutorial. I accomplished the background music goal. At it's core, the project turned out to be something resembling what I wanted; however, I failed to make it unique and include my own style.

# Specific Challenges
A big challenge was understanding how images overlap in pygame. For that reason, I failed to create a nice background, and ultimately ended up using the "track" provided by the video. I did modify the position and size of my character assets to better fit 
the background and track though. I did the same thing for the enemies that appear throughout the level. It was also difficult figuring out how to make the music play throughout the game. Initially, it had been playing only during the menu, but I 
figured it out.

An overview of everything:
The folders/files in my project are the asset folder and the sound file. Within the assets folder there are more folders for the character sprites, enemy sprites (ground and air), and miscelanous sprites such as the repeat, ground, gameover, and clouds.
I really wanted to make the background more unique. My intention was to add viliage sprites from Fire Emblem (the source of the character and enemy sprites). Specifically, I wanted to place villiager houses and random intervals, just like the clouds
do from the tutorial I followed. 

All the changes I made include: changing the positions of the assets, adding background music, adding a level counter in addition to the score counter, changing the score counter to an experience counter, and including/resizing/croping my own assets and
replacing the ones used in the tutorial.
