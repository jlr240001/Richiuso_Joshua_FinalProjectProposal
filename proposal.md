## Repository
https://github.com/jlr240001/Richiuso_Joshua_FinalProjectProposal.git

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.

## Features
- Sideways Scrolling Display
	- The game will be a side-scrolling platformer, so the display will have to be animated horizontally.
- A Controllable Character With Basic Controls 
	- The game will feature a character which is controlled by the player whow ill be able to jump up down to collect items and avoid hazards.
- Music & Sound(Possibly)
	-The game will contain a simple song throughout, and there may be sound effects implemented to go along with item collection and hazard collision. 

## Challenges
- I will need to research how to create horizonal displays that are animated. 
- I will need to learn how to display a sprite/characterr that moves with the screen and responds to user inputs. 
- I will need to learn how to implement various sounds and connect them to various collisions/collections of the character/sprite. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is a simple 2D platformer that features simple obstacles, collectables, and environment(s). 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimum would be a functional 2D Platformer with a character/sprite that moves with the display and is controllable by the character.
